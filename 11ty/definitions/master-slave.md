## Impact

This outdated convention has strong associations with slavery which is exclusionary to members of our community who may continue to live with the negative impacts of slavery. It also demonstrates how pervasive racism is throughout our culture and lanuage. 

## Usage Tip

There are many alternative terminologies to describe the relationship between two components. It is important to be aware of empathy as well as diversity in the world of technology to ensure everyone feels welcome at the table.
